# Neo Geo Style Tabletop Arcade Cabinet Build Plans

## Overview

This document compiles resources and considerations for building a Neo Geo-style tabletop arcade cabinet to house a 25.5" NEC LCD2690WUXi monitor. Note that a 25.5" monitor is larger than typical tabletop/bartop cabinets (which usually accommodate 19-24" monitors), so plans may need significant adaptation.

## Monitor Specifications

- **Model:** NEC MultiSync LCD2690WUXi
- **Size:** 25.5" diagonal
- **Native Resolution:** 1920x1200 (16:10 aspect ratio)
- **Dimensions:** Check monitor's physical dimensions (width, height, depth) for cabinet planning
- **Weight:** Professional monitors can be heavy - ensure cabinet structure can support it

## Original Neo Geo Cabinet Dimensions

The original SNK Neo Geo cabinets designed for 25" monitors had these dimensions:
- **Neo 25 Cabinet:**
  - Width: 630 mm (24.8 inches)
  - Depth: 850 mm (33.5 inches)
  - Height: 1,368 mm (53.9 inches)

**Note:** These are full-size upright cabinet dimensions. For a tabletop version, you'll need to significantly reduce the height while maintaining width and depth for the monitor.

## Design Considerations for Tabletop Cabinet

### Key Dimensions to Plan

1. **Monitor Compartment:**
   - Must accommodate monitor width (typically ~22-23" for 25.5" monitor)
   - Must accommodate monitor depth (check monitor specifications)
   - Must accommodate monitor height
   - Add clearance for ventilation (2-3 inches recommended)

2. **Control Panel:**
   - Standard Neo Geo layout: 2 joysticks, 4 buttons per player
   - Typical width: 24-28 inches
   - Typical depth: 12-16 inches
   - Height: Comfortable for sitting/standing play

3. **Overall Cabinet Dimensions (Estimated for Tabletop):**
   - **Width:** 28-32 inches (to accommodate monitor + side panels)
   - **Depth:** 20-24 inches (monitor depth + control panel + back access)
   - **Height:** 18-24 inches (monitor height + control panel + base)
   - **Total Weight:** Consider monitor weight (25-30 lbs typical) + cabinet structure

### Structural Requirements

1. **Monitor Mounting:**
   - Reinforced shelf or mounting brackets
   - VESA mount compatibility (if monitor supports it)
   - Adequate support for monitor weight
   - Access for cable management

2. **Ventilation:**
   - Airflow around monitor (especially back)
   - Vents in back panel
   - Consider small fans if needed

3. **Access:**
   - Removable back panel for maintenance
   - Access to monitor controls
   - Access to GBS-8200 and power supplies
   - Access to supergun and MVS board

4. **Stability:**
   - Wide base for stability
   - Consider rubber feet or leveling feet
   - Weight distribution (monitor weight may require counterweight or wider base)

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Adapt Full-Size Plans
1. Start with ArcadeCab or Geek Pub full-size plans
2. Reduce height to tabletop dimensions (18-24 inches)
3. Maintain width and depth for monitor accommodation
4. Adjust control panel height for ergonomics

### Option 2: Custom Design Based on Monitor
1. Measure your monitor's exact dimensions
2. Design cabinet around monitor size
3. Use Neo Geo aesthetic elements (artwork, colors, button layout)
4. Reference original Neo Geo cabinet proportions

### Option 3: Modified Lowboy Style
1. Use lowboy cabinet plans as base
2. Expand width/depth for 25.5" monitor
3. Maintain lower profile for tabletop use

## Materials Needed

- **Wood:** 3/4" MDF or plywood (recommended for stability)
- **Hardware:** Screws, brackets, hinges for access panels
- **Ventilation:** Grill material, optional fans
- **Finish:** Paint, vinyl artwork, or laminate
- **Controls:** Neo Geo style joysticks and buttons
- **Wiring:** Cable management, power distribution

## Important Notes

1. **Size Consideration:** A 25.5" monitor in a tabletop cabinet will be quite large. Consider if a smaller monitor (19-24") might be more practical for tabletop use.

2. **Weight:** Professional monitors are heavy. Ensure the cabinet structure and base can support the weight safely.

3. **Ergonomics:** Test control panel height and viewing angle before finalizing dimensions.

4. **Portability:** If you want the cabinet to be portable, consider weight and handle placement.

5. **Ventilation:** LCD monitors generate heat. Ensure adequate airflow to prevent overheating.

## Next Steps

1. Measure your monitor's exact physical dimensions
2. Download and review the recommended plans
3. Create a scaled drawing or 3D model
4. Build a mockup or test fit before final construction
5. Consider professional help for complex cuts or if unsure about structural integrity
